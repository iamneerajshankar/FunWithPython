****************************************************************************************************
We use @classmethod decorator in python to create a class method and we use @staticmethod decorator to create a static method in python.

**Class method vs Static Method**

1. A class method takes cls as the first parameter while a static method needs no specific parameters.
2. A class method can access or modify the class state while a static method canâ€™t access or modify it.
3. In general, static methods know nothing about the class state. They are utility-type methods 
   that take some parameters and work upon those parameters. On the other hand class methods must have 
   class as a parameter.
